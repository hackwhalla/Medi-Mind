# Medi-Mind.

🧠 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis & Assistance System
This project provides an end-to-end AI-based communicational healthcare assistant to predict diseases, suggest medicines (including Ayurveda and home remedies), and even facilitate emergency transport and video consultation. The aim is to offer an affordable, accessible, and semi-automated diagnostic tool, especially useful in rural and underserved areas.

🗂️ Workflow Overview
Below is a summarized explanation of the flow chart represented in the system:

Patient Input:

A user (patient) provides either:
Symptoms indicating a seasonal disease.
Multiple symptoms indicating a multi-symptom disease.
Their thoughts/feelings about the illness.
AI & ML Processing:

A Machine Learning model detects seasonal diseases and outputs Ayurvedic Medicines, Exercises, and Home Remedies.
For multi-symptom or complex cases, the system uses an AI Model to predict the likely disease using patient inputs and emotional data.
Prediction Verification:

The Predicted Disease is verified by:
A Final Year Medical Student, who suggests appropriate medicine.
The process is then double-verified by a Certified Doctor, validating patient thoughts, predicted illness, and suggested medication.
User Assistance & Integration:

Medicines are displayed to the patient.
Integration with:
Pharmacy App to order medicines.
Ola App for emergency transport.
Video Call Appointment system if further consultation is required.
